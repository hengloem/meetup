# Meetup HTML Template
Meetup is a free one page html template suited for promoting an event. Section include intro overview, speaker, multi-price ticket option, event schedule (with day switcher), a contact and a Twitter feed. You'd have to integrate those Buy button into something like PayPal, Gumroad or Shopify. Overall the design is fairly basic - I actually quite like speaker section - but a great starting point to announcing your event on low budget.
